Regime Wrapper Sweep Test Contract

## 1. Test Scope
- Tests cover wrapper behavior only.
- Kernel semantics are treated as opaque.

## 2. Sweep Axes
- Regime Context presence: {MISSING, PRESENT}
- Regime status: {REGIME_DECLARED, REGIME_NOT_DECLARED, REGIME_UNKNOWN}
- regime_id: {SETTLEMENT_RAILS_INCIDENT, STABLECOIN_PEG_EVENT, BANK_LIQUIDITY_EVENT}
- semantics_version: {v0, UNKNOWN}

## 3. Expected Outcomes Table

## 4. Invariants Validated
- Kernel is never invoked unless REGIME_DECLARED.
- Wrapper refusal provenance is distinct from kernel refusal.
- No kernel output alters regime status.
- Absence of Regime Context is terminal at wrapper level.

## 5. Non-Claims
- No claims about admissibility.
- No claims about action authorization.
- No claims about decision correctness.
- No claims about G0 activation logic.
