Regime Wrapper Cross-Snapshot Stability Sweep Test Contract

## 1. Test Scope
- Cross-snapshot stability tests only.
- Kernel semantics are opaque and out of scope.

## 2. Sweep Axes
- scope_id: {S₁, S₂, S₃} within the same case; no ordering semantics.
- Regime Context presence: {MISSING, PRESENT}
- Regime status: {REGIME_DECLARED, REGIME_NOT_DECLARED, REGIME_UNKNOWN}
- regime_id: {SETTLEMENT_RAILS_INCIDENT, STABLECOIN_PEG_EVENT, BANK_LIQUIDITY_EVENT}
- semantics_version: v0

## 3. Stability Requirement
- For a fixed regime_status and regime_id, wrapper outcome is identical across all scope_id values.
- scope_id variation MUST NOT:
  - upgrade REGIME_NOT_DECLARED or REGIME_UNKNOWN
  - downgrade REGIME_DECLARED
  - change refusal type
  - influence kernel invocation eligibility

## 5. Invariants Validated
- Snapshot identity is not a decision-existence signal.
- Snapshot change does not create or destroy regime declaration.
- Wrapper behavior is stable under snapshot churn.
- Kernel is never invoked unless REGIME_DECLARED.

## 6. Non-Claims
- No claims about admissibility.
- No claims about authorization.
- No claims about decision correctness.
- No claims about kernel gate behavior.
- No temporal or causal ordering claims between snapshots.
